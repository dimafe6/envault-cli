# Envault CLI

The Envault CLI allows you to connect to your [Envault server](https://github.com/dimafe6/envault-cli) and sync its credentials to your local .env file.

## Usage

To use the Envault CLI, you must have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your computer.

On your Envault dashboard, you will find an initialization command for each environment, which you can run to establish a connection to your Envault server, and pull your variables. This command only needs to be run the first time you connect your .env to Envault. An example initialization command:

```
npx envault-ex vault.envault.dev 84632 iCNaGGLou6v0mRas
```

After you've run your environment initialization command for the first time, you can pull your .env again easily:

```
npx envault-ex
```

### Secure files

Secure files will be downloaded to the ./.secure_files directory. 

### Options

By default, Envault will not pull variables that are not already present in your .env file. To enable this behaviour, use the `--constructive` flag:

```
npx envault-ex --constructive
```

You are able to customise the name of your .env file using the `--filename` flag:

```
npx envault-ex vault.envault.dev 84632 iCNaGGLou6v0mRas --filename=.myenv
```

The Envault CLI will sometimes prompt you to confirm your actions, especially those made in constructive mode. To bypass these prompts, use the `--force` flag:

```
npx envault-ex --force
```

The Envault CLI will prompt you to confirm replace exists Secured Files. To bypass these prompts, use the `--forceDownload` flag. And all local files will be replaced server files:

```
npx envault-ex --forceDownload
```

### Handling  multiple environments

You can store multiple environments instead of overwriting when authenticating a new environment.

You are able to sync a specific `.env` by providing the server and environment ID. This is especially useful if you have multiple `.env` files. For example:

```bash
npx envault-ex envault.server.test 1 llT8J6tEDbtJgSln 
npx envault-ex envault.server.test 2 BXYtZdNkQjtWSqE6
```

Now, you may sync each environment:

```bash
npx envault-ex 												// Will still sync .env from "1"
npx envault-ex envault.server.test 2 --filename=.env.settings  // Will sync .env.settings from "2"
```

If no server and environment provided it will default to the first environment that was added.
